In Hog Wild, you play a duck herding pigs into their pens. Get close to a pig, and it will run away from you. Use this to guide them where you want them to go. Don’t let them fall into black holes, though.

I made this game prototype in 48 hours for the Game Maker’s Toolkit (GMTK) Game Jam 2020. I wasn’t as serious about it as I probably should’ve been, but I’m still decently happy with the result.
